# Friend Chatbot


This chatbot will initiate a conversation with the user, interacting with them like a friend. It will be able to understand the gist of what the user is saying, and (hopefully) respond in an appropriate way.

It focuses on 2 major sports, including football(soccer) and basketball, but can also discuss other topics like pets and hobbies.

<h3>Dependencies:</h3>
The NLTK Python library must first be downloaded. Installation instructions can be found <a href="https://www.nltk.org/install.html">here.</a>

The simplest way is to run `python -m pip install nltk`
Then, a few NLTK modules must be downloaded. They can be downloaded by running Python in the command line and typing the following:

```
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
```
Additional modules to be imported include spellchecker, tkinter and PIL

<h3>Usage:</h3>

All conversation topics are handled dynamically in `convo.dat`. The first line of a topic is structured as follows:

<b>`. or ?` `keywords` (`^variable.wordType` OR `+`)</b>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>

`. or ?`: Depending on whether the topic expects a statement (.) or question (?) from the user (although currently unused).

`keywords`: When looking for only one of a multiple set of similar keywords, separate them with /'s (eg, hi/hey/hello). When looking for another set/single keyword, separate with &'s (eg, i&like&ham). Note that they must all be lowercase. Combined example: do&you/u&like/enjoy&soccer/football

`^variable`: Used when expecting to detect a single word from the user to save in memory, referenced by the give name ('variable' in this case)

`.wordType`: Dictates which word type (as defined by the NLTK library. eg, NNP = proper noun, VB = verb) to look for in the user's response, in order to help determine which word to save as the answer 'variable'.

`+`: Used when expecting to detect the positivity of the user's following response.
Note: Only one of `^variable.wordType` and `+` may be used at a time. In other words, the chatbot cannot handle both determining the positivity of the user's next response as well as saving a certain answer from it.




The rest of the topic is separated by newlines, with the bot waiting a response between each line before printing the next line.

In order to reference a saved answer from the user (`^variable` from before), simply put `$variable` in the bot's response, which will be replaced by the saved answer. Note that an answer must first be saved before it can be called like this. Otherwise, it will return "NaN" instead.

When using the `+` operator, the following 3 lines must start with `+` (positive), `-` (negative), and `0` (neutral), in any order. The positivity score of the user's last response will be used to determine which of these three responses to output.




<h3>Limitations:</h3>

`convo.dat` file must begin with an empty line, and end with two empty lines.

First 2 topics of convo.dat must be default statement response and default question response, respectively.

Correlation algorithm likely won't scale well when many more topics are added.

Doesn't handle context well; user must explicitly mention what they're referring to each time they ask a question.

Can't both save an answer and determine the positivity of a single user response.

If the `+` operator is used, the next 3 lines MUST start with each one of `+`, `-`, and `0`.



<h3>Key Features:</h3>

Key features of this chatbot include:
1. GUI with frame for user input, as well as a frame displaying message history. Has unique window icon, instead of the generic tkinter icon. Also has scrollbar for easy navigation.
  - incomplete, as GUI only displays user input unto message history. It was fairly difficult and time consuming to connect and display live chatbot output console to the GUI, so the GUI code is commented out in convoDemo.py, but can be run in GUI.py to show functionality of its features.
2. multiple topics of discussion (focuses on similar sports: football(soccer) and basketball, but accommodates discussion about pets and hobbies).
  - User:"who is your fave football player?" 
  - Charles:my favorite football player is Cristiano Ronaldo!
  - "who is your fave basketball player?"
  - my favorite basketball player is Lebron James
3. 8 reasonable responses to unrecognized user inputs. 5 for unrecognized statements and 3 for unrecognized questions. These responses are randomly selected to avoid repetition and encourage variety in conversation.
  - "giddyup!"
  - Not sure what that means, Ask me who my fave football player is!
4. spellchecker that handles spelling mistakes and replaces misspelled word(s) with most likely match.
  - "what do yuo like doing"
  - I like talking to people like you!
5. POS tagging to distinguish parts of speech and understand grammar.
  - "what club do lebron play for?"
  - he plays for Los Angeles Lakers!
6. Sentiment analysis tool to distinguish between positive, negative and neutral inputs, and determine what chatbot replies.
  - do you have any pets?
  - "no"
  - you can always adopt one!
  - "oh"
  - I think pets make the best companions, besides me of course!
